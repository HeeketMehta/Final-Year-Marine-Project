# Marine-Life-Sustainability-using-ML

Problem Statement -
In this project, we implement the task of analyzing the water quality containing various attributes and characteristics of numerous rivers and water bodies in multiple states of India since the water is highly polluted.
To do so, we develop a model to calculate and categorize the quality of water based on parameters like ‘pH’, ‘Temp’, ‘D. O.’ by determining an attribute Water Quality Index (WQI) using supervised machine learning algorithms.
Results of this model will be extrapolated to calculate sustainable water quality for marine life salubriousness.
Moreover, our aim is to categorize the freshness of fish based on fish tissues using image processing and computer vision.

Overview - In this project, we have made an attempt to study the quality of water. There are many quality parameters like  ‘pH’, ‘Temperature’, ‘Dissolved Oxygen (DO)’, etc. which plays a key role in determining the Water quality index (WQI). 
The WQI values range from 19.3 to 99.8 which are then scaled down and classified into five categories using Random Forest Algorithm, K- Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine.­­­­­­­­­ By taking the WQI into consideration.
The results obtained by the Random Forest Algorithm provides 92.127% accuracy in classifying the water quality. 
The results were visualized on the basis of various years and states in India.
